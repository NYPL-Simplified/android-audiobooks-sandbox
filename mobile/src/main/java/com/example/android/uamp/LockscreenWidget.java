/**
 * Implementation of App Widget functionality.
 * App Widget Configuration implemented in {@link LockscreenWidgetConfigureActivity LockscreenWidgetConfigureActivity}
 * This is the widget's broadcast receiver.
 * The AppWidgetProvider class implements the onReceive() method, extracts the required information and calls the onUpdate/onDeleted/onEnabled/onDisabled widget life cycle methods.

 A widget has the same runtime restrictions as a normal broadcast receiver, i.e., it has only 5 seconds to finish its processing.

 A receive (widget) should therefore perform time consuming operations in a service and perform the update of the widgets from the service.

 *A widget gets its data on a periodic timetable. There are two methods to update a widget, one is based on an XML configuration file and the other is based on the Android AlarmManager service.
 *
 * In the widget configuration file you can specify a fixed update interval. The system will wake up after this time interval and call your broadcast receiver to update the widget. The smallest update interval is 1800000 milliseconds (30 minutes).

 The AlarmManager allows you to be more resource efficient and to have a higher frequency of updates. To use this approach, you define a service and schedule this service via the AlarmManager regularly. This service updates the widget.

 Please note that a higher update frequency will wake up the phone from the energy safe mode. As a result your widget consumes more energy.
