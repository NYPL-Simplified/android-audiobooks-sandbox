Audiobook Sandbox
=====================================

This is the repository for our proof-of-concept code to display, play, and manipulate audiobooks in SimplyE.
The project is not ready for outside contributions, but we're always happy to hear suggestions.

The project utilizes Google's Universal Music Player sample project.

--------------

- Android SDK v17


Interesting Code Locations
--------------------------

- The Table Of Contents nav bar is coded for in com.example.android.uamp.ui.ActionBarCastActivity.populateDrawerItems().
